# Hi there! My name is Gideon.ðŸ‘‹
And i'm a student in BSc Software Engineering. Mostly of my life was dedicated to fixing computers, making cool scripts and ofcourse (it's bad I know) finding ways to get free software. But nowadays i'm fascinated by the world of code. I've learned most of my code by just watching tutorials on the internet, but now it's time to make things professional. So I went back to school again, but this time to learn more about code and using it in my work environments. Luckily i've got good employer who believes in my path.

## What I'm working on what you guys can't see.
